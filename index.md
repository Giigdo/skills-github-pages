# Natural Movement to Digital Code: Indigenous Perspectives in Computer Science
This hands-on workshop demonstrates an Indigenous approach to teaching computer programming through the observation and computational modeling of animal behaviours. Using Reynolds' steering behaviours framework, participants will explore how traditional ecological knowledge can integrate with fundamental programming concepts through hands-on coding exercises. Working in a browser-based environment, participants will modify JavaScript code that simulates natural animal movements, adjusting behavioural parameters and creating new rules based on their understanding of local wildlife. This approach bridges Indigenous ways of knowing with computer science education by grounding programming concepts in observable natural phenomena. The workshop illustrates how this pedagogical method can make programming more accessible and culturally relevant for Indigenous students while maintaining technical rigor, providing a practical model for decolonizing computer science education in secondary schools.
