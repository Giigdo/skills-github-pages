# Testing the blog post
This is a test of the blog post feature. I will have to try something elese later.
This interactive workshop demonstrates an Indigenous approach to teaching computer programming through the observation and computational modeling of animal behaviors. Drawing from Reynolds' steering behaviors framework, participants will explore how traditional ecological knowledge and observation practices can be integrated with fundamental programming concepts. The session begins with an examination of basic JavaScript implementation of autonomous agents, allowing participants to modify and experiment with code that simulates natural animal movements and interactions.
